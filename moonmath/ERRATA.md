# Errata (v1.1.1)

Some errors in version 1.1.1 (I might be wrong though).

## Chapter 3

- Page 27, Example 19: $\deg(P_5)$ twice
- Page 28, Example 20: on $P_3(-4)$

## Chapter 4

- Page 31, it says example XXX
- Page 41, Algorithm 5: it says example XXX
- Page 47, Example 45: bugged?
- Page 47, we have $H_(x_2)$ instead of $H(x_2)$
- Page 55, above 4.35 it says "rage" instead of "range"
- Page 59, Alg. 6, `return z` instead of `return x`

## Chapter 5

- Page 73, The discriminant in the snippet is different than `E.discriminant()`?
- Page 84, at the top why does it map to $\mathbb{G}_2$? Shouldn't it say $E_{1, 1}(\mathbb{F}_3)[3]$?
- Page 84, instead of saying "tangent rule repeatedly" it should say "tangent & chord rules repeatedly"?
- Page 95, in eq 5.35 the paragraphs can use `\left(` and `\right)`
- Page 96, above 5.37 it should probably say "Short Weierstrass or Montgomery representation"
- Page 97, end of 3rd paragraph should be $(-x_1, y_1)$.
