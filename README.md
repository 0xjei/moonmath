    Usage
</h3>

See [Chapter 2](./software-used/) for the required software. If you don't have Sage installed, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) mounted over the repository. We have scripts for that:

```sh
make pull     # pull the SageMath image
make sage     # open Sage CLI
make notebook # open Jupyter Notebook with Sage
```

We also have a script that converts all the notebooks into Markdown format via `jupyter nbconvert` so that they are easier to read on the web from the READMEs alone:

```sh
make markdown
```
