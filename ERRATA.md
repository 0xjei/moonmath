Some possible errors in version 1.1.1.

## Chapter 3

- Page 27, Example 19: $\deg(P_5)$ twice
- Page 28, Example 20: on $P_3(-4)$
- Page 28, Exercise 25: "from from"

## Chapter 4

- Page 31, it says example XXX
- Page 41, Algorithm 5: it says example XXX
- Page 47, Example 45: bugged?
- Page 47, we have $H_(x_2)$ instead of $H(x_2)$
- Page 50, "see section4.1.6.1" missing space
- Page 55, above 4.35 it says "rage" instead of "range"
- Page 59, Alg. 6, `return z` instead of `return x`

## Chapter 5

- Page 73, The discriminant in the snippet is different than `E.discriminant()`?
- Page 77, exercise 62, says $E_{5, 2}$ but should say $E_{7, 5}$
- Page 84, at the top why does it map to $\mathbb{G}_2$? Shouldn't it say $E_{1, 1}(\mathbb{F}_3)[3]$?
- Page 84, instead of saying "tangent rule repeatedly" it should say "tangent & chord rules repeatedly"?
- Page 86, exercise 64, parentheses missing at $[8](0, 1)$
- Page 95, in eq 5.35 the paragraphs can use `\left(` and `\right)`
- Page 96, above 5.37 it should probably say "Short Weierstrass or Montgomery representation"
- Page 97, end of 3rd paragraph should be $(-x_1, y_1)$.
- Page 102, end of exercise 78 should say $alt\_bn128(\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})$
- Page 103, Example 92, "doing this for 815730721 _elements_ is a bit too slow..."
- Page 108, top of the page says "add this to references"
- Page 110, Algorithm 9, should be $y^2 \gets x^3 + a\cdot x + b$

## Chapter 6

- Page 135, Example 116 should say $R_{tiny, jj}(<x_1, \ldots, x_n>) = true$.
- Page 136, Exercise 96, missing double quote at the end
- Page 138, Example 119 second equation has $m = m$, should say $m = 2$.
- Page 140, Footnote, says equation XXX
- Page 152, just above exercise 101, "126implies" space bug
- Page 158, Eqn 6.15 probably should say $j = 0$ instead of $h = 0$?

## Chapter 7

- Page 177, exercise 103, extra `,` at the end of line with `fn foo`.
- Page 177, exercise 103, in `fn main` should be `in_2 : F`.
- Page 188, "unigned" integer operators
- Page 193, "We get" at the end of page.
