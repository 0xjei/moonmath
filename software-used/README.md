# Chapter 2: Software Used in this Book

You must install [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) and [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/). For SageMath, I use the [Conda installation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html) method, which can be activated as follows:

```sh
# activate sage environment
conda activate sage
# launch sage
sage
```

Within Sage, you can run files via:

```py
sage: load("./path-to-file.sage")
```
