# Chapter 3: Arithmetics

Topics in this chapter:

- Integer Arithmetic
- Modular Arithmetic
- Polynomial Arithmetic

## Exercise 1

> What are the absolute values of integers -123, 27 and 0?

123, 27 and 0.

## Exercise 2

> Compute the factorization of 30030 and double check your results with Sage.

We find $2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 11 \times 13 \times 7$, which Sage confirms as:

```py
sage: factor(30030)
2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13
```

## Exercise 3

> For $4x + 21 = 5$, compute the set of all solutions for $x$ under the alternative assumptions:
>
> - equation is defined over set of natural numbers
> - equation is defined over set of integers

For natural numbers, we have no solutions. However, for integers, we have $x = -4 \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Exercise 4

> For $2x^3 - x^2 - 2x = -1$, compute the set of all solutions for $x$ under the alternative assumptions:
>
> - equation is defined over set of natural numbers
> - equation is defined over set of integers
> - equation is defined over set of rational numbers

With a quick manipulation, we can see that $(2x)(x^2 - 1) = x^2 - 1$. With this form $x=1$ and $x=-1$ is a solution.

We can also find an $x$ such that $|x| \ne 1$ by dividing both sides by $x^2 - 1$, and obtain $2x=1$ to find $x=1/2$. The sets of solutions are thus:

- $\{1\} \in \mathbb{N}$
- $\{1, -1\} \in \mathbb{Z}$
- $\{1, -1, 1/2\} \in \mathbb{Q}$

## Exercise 5

> Find an $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ and an $r \in \mathbb{N}$ with $0 \leq r < |b|$ such that $a = mb + r$ holds for the following pairs:
>
> 1. $(a, b) = (27, 5)$
> 2. $(a, b) = (-27, 5)$
> 3. $(a, b) = (127, 0)$
> 4. $(a, b) = (-1687, 11)$
> 5. $(a, b) = (0, 7)$
>
> In which cases are your solutions unique?

1. $m = 5, r = 2$
2. $m = -5, r = 2$
3. No solutions possible because we get $0 \leq r < 0$ due to $b = 0$.
4. $m = -154, r = 7$, which we find by solving for $(1687, 11)$ first.
5. $m = 0, r = 0$.

All solutions are unique.

## Exercise 6 ðŸ”´

> Using the programming language of your choice, write an algorithm that computes integer long divison and handles all edge cases properly.

TODO

## Exercise 7

> Write an algorithm that computes the binary representation of any non-negative integer.

There are many many implementations out there, but here is one for Circom:

```cpp
template Num2Bits(n) {
  assert(n < 254); // due to BN128
  signal input in;
  signal output out[n];

  var lc = 0;
  var bit_value = 1;

  for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    out[i] <-- (in >> i) & 1;
    out[i] * (out[i] - 1) === 0;

    lc += out[i] * bit_value;
    bit_value <<= 1;
  }

  lc === in;
}
```

## Exercise 8

> Find integers $s, t \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\gcd(a, b) = sa + tb$ holds for the following pairs:
>
> - $(a, b) = (45, 10)$
> - $(a, b) = (13, 11)$
> - $(a, b) = (13, 12)$

- $5 = (1) \times 45 + (-4) \times 10$
- $1 = (-5) \times 13 + (6) \times 11$
- $1 = (1) \times 13 + (-1) \times 12$

## Exercise 9

> What is $gcd(n,p)$ for some natural number $n$ and a prime $p$ such that $n < p$?

Well, it's 1. In particular, a prime number is defined to be only divisible by itself, or 1. Since the `gcd` must be one of these, it is definitely not $p$ since $n < p$, so it must be $1$.

```py
p = random_prime(2 ^ 256)
n = ZZ.random_element(p)
print(gcd(p, n))
```

## Exercise 10

> Find all numbers $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $0 \leq k \leq 100$ such that $\gcd(100, k) = 5$.

We begin by reducing the GCD:

$$
\gcd(5 \times 20, 5 \times k') = 5 \implies \gcd(20, k') = 1
$$

From this, we simply list out all the primes less than 20:

$$
k' \in \{19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 3\}
$$

Our solutions for $k$ is therefore these numbers multiplied by 5:

$$
k \in \{95, 85, 65, 55, 35, 15\}
$$

## Exercise 11

> Show that $\gcd(n, m) = \gcd(n + m, m)$ for all $n, m \in \mathbb{N}$.

- Let $g$ denote $\gcd(n, m)$.
- Then, $g \mid n$ and $g \mid m$. So, $n = g n'$ and $m = g m'$.
- Now we ask $\gcd(g n' + m, g m') =\gcd(g n' + g m', g m') = \gcd(g(n' + m'), g m')$.
- This is equal to $g$, which is $\gcd(n, m)$.

## Exercise 12

> Consider exercise 8 again, which pairs $(a, b)$ form that exercise are coprime?

Pairs $(13, 11)$ and $(13, 12)$ are coprime.

## Exercise 13

> Write the octal numbers $0o1354$ and $0o777$ into their decimal representations.

- $0o1354 \to 4\times8^0 + 5\times8^1 + 3 \times 8^2 + 1\times8^3 = 748$
- $0o777$ is actually $0o1000 - 0o1$ so we can find $8^3 - 1 = 511$

## Exercise 14

> Which of the following pairs of numbers are congruent with respect to the modulus $13$?
>
> - $(5, 19)$
> - $(13, 0)$
> - $(-4, 9)$
> - $(0, 0)$

- $5 \not\equiv 13 + 6 \pmod{13}$
- $13 + 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{13}$
- $13 + (-4) = 13 + (9 - 13) \equiv 9 \pmod{13}$
- $0 \equiv 0 \pmod{13}$

## Exercise 15

> Find all integers $x$ such that the congruence $x \equiv 4 \pmod{6}$ is satisfied.

All numbers of the form $6k + 4$ for integer $k$ satisfy this congruence.

## Exercise 16

> Find all solutions $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ to the following congruence:
>
> $$5x + 4 \equiv 28 + 2x \pmod{13}$$

By reducing we find $3x \equiv 24 \pmod{13}$. We need to get rid of the 3 in $3x$, so we must multiply $3x$ by some $k$ where $3k = 1$.

Fermat's Little Theorem tells us that $3^{13 - 2} \pmod{13}$ would give us that $k$, which we find to be 9. Multiplying both sides with 9, we get $x \equiv 216 \equiv 8 \pmod{13}$.

## Exercise 17

> Find all solutions $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ to the following congruence:
>
> $$69x \equiv 5 \pmod{23}$$

Due to mod 23, we get $0x \equiv 5 \pmod{23}$, so there are no solutions.

## Exercise 18

> Find all solutions $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ to the following congruence:
>
> $$69x \equiv 46 \pmod{23}$$

Due to mod 23, we get $0x \equiv 0 \pmod{23}$, so all $x$ are solutions.

## Exercise 19

> Show that for $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ the equivalence $a^k \equiv b^k \pmod{n}$ holds.

It comes from "compatibility with multiplication" which is the rule that

$$
a_1 \equiv b_1 \pmod{n} \text{ and } a_2 \equiv b_2 \pmod{n} \implies a_1a_2 \equiv b_1b_2 \pmod{n}
$$

implying one by one the equivalences $a^i \equiv b^i \pmod{n}$ for $i = 2, 3, \ldots, k$.

You can also prove this by induction to show $a^1 \equiv b^1 \pmod{n}$ and assume $a^{k-1} \equiv b^{k-1} \pmod{n}$.

## Exercise 20 âœ¨

> Let $a, n$ be integers, such that $a$ and $n$ are **not** co-prime. For which $b \in \mathbb{Z}$ does $ax \equiv b \pmod{n}$ have a solution $x$, and how does the solution set look like?

The equivalence implies $ax - ny = b$. Denote $d=\gcd(a, n)$ which also implies $a = da'$ and $n = dn'$. Now, supposing that the solution exists for $ax - ny = b$ for some $x', y'$:

$$b = ax' - ny' = da'x' - dn'y' = d(a'x' - n'y')$$

Since $a', x', n', y'$ are all integers, $b / d$ must be an integer too; implying that $d \mid b$. In other words, solutions exists for $b \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $\gcd(a, n) \mid b$.

Now that we also know $b = db'$, let's rewrite the congruence:

$$da'x \equiv db' \pmod{dn'}$$

We can remove $d$ from all sides:

$$a'x \equiv b' \pmod{n'}$$

Since $\gcd(a', n') = 1$, this has only one solution. Denote this solution as $t$ where $x \equiv t \pmod{n'}$. The other solutions are the numbers from $t$ to $t + n$, with increments of $n'$. Notice that:

- $t \implies da'(t) \equiv db' \pmod{dn'}$
- $t + n' \implies da'(t + n') = da't + a'dn' = da' \equiv db' \pmod{dn'}$
- $t + 2n' \implies da'(t + 2n') = da't + 2a'dn' = da' \equiv db' \pmod{dn'}$
- $\ldots$
- $t + dn' \implies da'(t + dn') = da't + da'dn' = da' \equiv db' \pmod{dn'}$

Since $t + (d+1)n' = t + n' + dn'$ would be equivalent to $t + n'$ in modulo $n'$, we start to wrap around the solution set of $x$. That is our complete set of solutions with $d$ elements.

## Exercise 21

> Define $\mathbb{Z}_{13}$ as the arithmetic modulo 13. Consider the following equation:
>
> $$5x + 4 \equiv 28x +2x \pmod{13}$$
>
> Rewrite this in $\mathbb{Z}_{13}$.

We have:

$$5x + 4 \equiv 2 + 2x \pmod{13}$$
$$3x + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{13}$$
$$3x \equiv 11 \pmod{13}$$

Now, which integers $x \in \mathbb{Z}_{13}$ give $11 \pmod{13}$ when multiplied by 3? Instead of asking that, here I can ask what is the inverse of 3 in modulo 13, that is, which number when multiplied by 3 gives 1?

We know that $3 \times 9 = 27 \equiv 1 \pmod{13}$, so I can multiply both sides with 9.

$$x \equiv 99 \equiv 8 \pmod{13}$$

Meaning that all integers of the form $13k+8, k \in \mathbb{N}$ solve this equation.

## Exercise 22

> Which of the integers 7, 1, 0, 805, -4255 have multiplicative inverses in modular 24 arithmetic?

First let's get rid of the trivial cases:

- 1 is always it's own inverse.
- 0 never has a multiplicative inverse.

We can check GCD for the remaining numbers:

```py
sage: gcd(7, 24), gcd(805, 24), gcd(-4255, 24)
(1, 1, 1)
```

Apparently, all of these are coprime to 24. We can perhaps use Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which I implemented in Sage already. Using `xgcd(a, b)` where `a >= b` we can find:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = s \times a + t \times b
$$

First, let's treat all numbers in mod 24, so $805 \equiv 13 \pmod{24}$ and $-4255 \equiv 17 \pmod{24}$. Then, let's use `xgcd` as follows:

```py
sage: load("./arithmetics/xgcd-crt.sage")
sage: print(xgcd(24, 7))
....: print(xgcd(24, 13))
....: print(xgcd(24, 17))
(1, -2, 7)
(1, 6, -11)
(1, 5, -7)
```

To interpret these results:

- $7^{-1} \equiv 7 \pmod{24}$
- $13^{-1} \equiv -11 \equiv 13 \pmod{24}$
- $17^{-1} \equiv -7 \equiv 17 \pmod{24}$

These numbers all are their own inverses, nice!

## Exercise 23

> Find the set of all solutions to the congruence $17(2x + 5) - 4 \equiv 2x + 4 \pmod{5}$. Then, project the congruence into $\mathbb{Z}_5$ and solve the resulting equation in $\mathbb{Z}_5$.

Due to mod 5, we find:

$$
2(2x) + 1 \equiv 2x + 4 \pmod{5}
$$

$$
2x \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
$$

We have $2^{-1} \equiv 2^{5-2} \pmod{5}$ which is 3. Multipyling both sides with 3 we find:

$$
x \equiv 4 \pmod{5}
$$

## Exercise 24

> Find the set of all solutions to the congruence $17(2x + 5) - 4 \equiv 2x + 4 \pmod{6}$. Then, project the congruence into $\mathbb{Z}_6$ and _try to solve_ the resulting equation in $\mathbb{Z}_6$.

Due to mod 6 we find:

$$
5(2x + 5) + 2 \equiv 2x + 4 \pmod{6}
$$

$$
8x + 23 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}
$$

$$
2x \equiv 1 \pmod{6}
$$

This has no solutions. No way to think about it is that for something to be 1 in mod 6, it has to be an odd number. The left-hand side of this congruence will always be an even number.

## Exercise 25

> Compare both expansions of $P_7$ from $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ in example 18 and from $\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ in example 19. Can you see how definition of $P_7$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ projects to the definition over $\mathbb{Z}_6$, if you consider the residue classes of $\mathbb{Z}_6$?

Our polynomial is $P_7(x) = (x-2)(x+3)(x-5)$, which is projected to be:

$$
P_7 \in \mathbb{Z}[x] = x^3 - 4x^2 - 11x + 30
$$

$$
P_7 \in \mathbb{Z}_6[x] = x^3 + 2x^2 + x
$$

We can compute the result in $\mathbb{Z}$ and then project the coefficients, that is equal to doing everything in $\mathbb{Z}_6$ in the first place!

## Exercise 26

> Compare the sum $P + Q$ and the product $P \cdot Q$ from the previous two examples 22 and 23. How can we derive the computations in $\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ from the computations in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$?

We can find the answers in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, and then project the coefficients from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_6$, giving us the answer in $\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$.

## Exercise 27

> Consider polynomials $A(x) := -3x^4 + 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 4$ and $B(x) = x^2 - 4x + 2$. Compute the Euclidean Division of A by B in the following types:
>
> - $A, B \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$
> - $A, B \in \mathbb{Z}_6[x]$
> - $A, B \in \mathbb{Z}_5[x]$

We can calculate the result with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$ and then project it to the others. I used Sage instead of doing by hand:

```py
sage: ZZx = ZZ['x']
sage: A = ZZx(-3*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 2*x^2 + 4)
sage: B = ZZx(x^2 - 4*x + 2)

# quotient
sage: A // B
-3*x^2 - 8*x - 24

# remainder
sage: A % B
-80*x + 52
```

The result of division is the quotient $Q$ and remainder $R$ polynomials:

- $Q(x) = -3x^2 -8x - 24$
- $R(x) = -80x + 52$

Projecting these to $\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$ we get:

- $Q(x) = 3x^2 + 4x$
- $R(x) = 4x + 4$

Projecting these to $\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$ we get:

- $Q(x) = 2x^2 + 2x + 1$
- $R(x) = 2$

## Exercise 28

> Show that the polynomial $B(x) = 2x^4 -3x +4 \in \mathbb{Z}_5[x]$ is a factor of the polynomial $A(x) = x^7 + 4x^6 + 4x^5 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 3 \in \mathbb{Z}_5[x]$.

The important thing here is to realize that you need to invert the leading coefficient. In the case of $B(x)$, that is 2. We need to find the inverse of 2, which we can via Fermat's Little Theorem as $2^{5-2} \bmod 5 = 3$. By doing the calculations by hand, I've found:

- $Q(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 2$

Let's verify from Sage:

```py
# Univariate Polynomial Ring in x
# over Ring of integers modulo 5
Z5x = Integers(5)[x]

A = Z5x(x^7 + 4*x^6 + 4*x^5 + x^3 + 2*x^2 + 2*x + 3)
B = Z5x(2*x^4 - 3*x + 4)

# expected result
Q = Z5x(3*x^3 + 2*x^2 + 2*x + 2)
Q == A / B # true
```

## Exercise 29 âœ¨

> Show that if a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X]$ of degree $\deg(P) = m$ has less than $m$ roots, it must have a prime factor $F$ such that $\deg(F) > 1$.

Suppose that $P$ has $k$ roots $\{z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_k\}$ such that $k < m$. Then, we know that:

$$
P(x) = (x - z_1)(x - z_2)\ldots(x - z_k)Q(x)
$$

From this, we can see that $P(x) = (x^k + \ldots)Q(x)$, meaning that $Q(x)$ must have degree $m - k$. $Q(x)$ itself may be reducible; however, none of it's factors may be linear because that would imply the existence of another root. So, $Q(x)$ must have at least one prime factor that is not linear (i.e. degree greater than 1), which implies $P(x)$ such a factor.

## Exercise 30

> Consider $P = x^7 + 3x^6 + 3x^5 + x^4 - x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_6[X]$. Find the set of all roots $R_0(P)$ and then compute the prime factorization of $P$.

Let's use Sage to find the roots.

```py
sage: Z6 = Integers(6)
sage: Z6x = Z6['x']
sage: P = Z6x(x^7 + 3*x^6 + 3*x^5 + x^4 - x^3 - 3*x^2 - 3*x - 1)

# find roots
sage: P.roots(multiplicities=False)
[1, 5]
```

To find factors, we can divide $x - r$ for each root $r$ until the quotient does not have $r$ as a root anymore. Once we are done with all roots, if the remaining result is not $1$ we can also include that as a factor.

I have implemented this [here](./polynomials.sage).

## Exercise 31

> Consider modular 5 arithmetic, and set $S = \{(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)\}$. Find a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{Z}_5[x]$ such that $P(x_i) = y_i$ for all $(x_i, y_i) \in S$.

We need to do lagrange interpolation for this. We could do by hand, but let's just use Sage for this one!

```py
sage: Integers(5)[x].lagrange_polynomial([(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)])
4*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 4*x
```

Apparently, $4x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x$ does the job!

## Exercise 32

> Consider the same set $S = \{(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)\}$. Why is it not possible to do Lagrange interpolation for these points in $\mathbb{Z}_6[x]$?

We can't, because we need the elements to have multiplicative inverses of the evaluated elements. In $\mathbb{Z}_6$, only 1 and 5 have multiplicative inverse; the other elements do not have a multiplicative inverse.
