## Exercise 33

> Let $\mathbb{Z}_5^*$ be the set of all remainder classes from $\mathbb{Z}_5$ without the class 0, meaning that $\mathbb{Z}_5^* = \mathbb{Z}_5 \backslash \{0\}$. Show that $(\mathbb{Z}_5, \cdot)$ is a commutative group (aka. Abelian Group).

The map $\cdot$ (multiplication) of all elements in $\mathbb{Z}_5$ have the following properties:

- Closed due to multiplication
- Associative due to multiplication
- Commutative due to multiplication
- Identity is $1 \in \mathbb{Z}_5$
- Inverse as all elements are co-prime to $5$

With all these properties, the group is commutative.

## Exercise 37

> Let $p \in \mathbb{P}$ be prime number and show that $(\mathbb{Z}_p^*, \cdot)$ is cyclic, i.e. it has a not necessarily unique single element that is able to generate the entire group.
